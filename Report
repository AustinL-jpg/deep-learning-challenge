Data Preprocessing

What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
The target variable was the 'IS_SUCCESSFUL' column from application_df dataframe.
What variable(s) are the features for your model?
The feature variables were every other column from application_df dataframe. 
We defined this by droping the 'IS_SUCCESSFUL' column from the original dataframe.
What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
We dropped both 'EIN' and 'NAME' columns, because they were not the targets for the dataframe.

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
The first attempt I used 8 hidden_nodes_layer1 and 5 hidden_nodes_layer2, the second I used 10 hidden_nodes_layer1 and 10 hidden_nodes_layer2, and for the third I used 20 hidden_nodes_layer1 and 20 hidden_nodes_layer2.

Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
I was able to reach a 72% which was not the target.

What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
I added more layers, removed more columns, and added additional hidden nodes to try and increase the performance.
